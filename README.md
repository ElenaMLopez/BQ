# BQ

Proof of code for the company BQ by Elena Mateos LÃ³pez.
# Notes:
- Used for H1 the supoused name of product.
- There wasn't guidelines to make the proof, so I decided not to use Grid, because you can see at Can I Use
web, there is some navigators that don't support it well.
- Used diferent archives for SASS in order to make the project scalable. Probably is not realy necessary make
this structure for a littel page like this, but I trying to learn the components structure in the best way
- Probably I make some branches, one for responsive version and one to practise Gulp.
- Any feedback will be realy good for me, so please give me it.
- Thanks a lot and hope you like it =D
